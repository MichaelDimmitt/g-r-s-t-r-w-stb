## Step 1 decompose a Rails scaffold 
<pre>
That project can be found here https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/g-r-s-t-r-w-bts
obviously this was not productive at all. no new features were built.
But one day I thought, what would happen if I just sledgehammered a new scaffold? 
I never thought that the program would break at the different commands.

My Rails story has been, do commands--> magic happens!
An unexpected discovery: you can match commands to files!
</pre>
## Step 2 Commit a Rails scaffold correctly.
<pre>
Since I can match commands to files

Committing the initial project scaffold should not be one commit 
and as a commit message ```commit -m "initial project scaffold;```

Instead, a scaffold should consist of adding files 
and eluciadating the commands that require these files!
</pre>
### Buildings dont just happen.<br>You cant build at the top until you understand which ladders get you where.
